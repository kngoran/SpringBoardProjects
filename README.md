Decision Tree Specialty Coffee Case Study
The Scenario
Imagine you've just finished the Springboard Data Science Career Track course, and have been hired by a rising popular specialty coffee company - RR Diner Coffee - as a data scientist. Congratulations!

RR Diner Coffee sells two types of thing:

specialty coffee beans, in bulk (by the kilogram only)
coffee equipment and merchandise (grinders, brewing equipment, mugs, books, t-shirts).
RR Diner Coffee has three stores, two in Europe and one in the USA. The flagshap store is in the USA, and everything is quality assessed there, before being shipped out. Customers further away from the USA flagship store have higher shipping charges.

You've been taken on at RR Diner Coffee because the company are turning towards using data science and machine learning to systematically make decisions about which coffee farmers they should strike deals with.

RR Diner Coffee typically buys coffee from farmers, processes it on site, brings it back to the USA, roasts it, packages it, markets it, and ships it (only in bulk, and after quality assurance) to customers internationally. These customers all own coffee shops in major cities like New York, Paris, London, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Berlin.
